# Typescript-Mastery

A repository to learn all the basics of typescript. In this repository I will be documenting my journey of learning typescript especially using the Dave Gray Youtube full course on typescript.

Many of the lessons are grouped into folders with the lesson number and a brief description of the lesson.
