## How to run the code

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the lesson05-Type_Casting directory.

```bash
cd lesson05-Type_Casting
```
3. Install TypeScript globally if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```
4. Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript using the Watch flag so you can see changes in real-time:

```bash
tsc -w
```
5. You can also check out the `src/copyright.ts` file to see how the copyright example was implemented.
6. Optionally open the `src/main.ts` file and make changes to see how TypeScript compiles it to JavaScript in the `build/js` directory.
7. Go to the build directory and open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the output of the copyright file.
