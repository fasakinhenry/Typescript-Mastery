# Lesson 03: Arrays and Objects

This lesson covers the concepts of arrays and objects in TypeScript. You will learn about array types, object types, and how to work with them effectively in TypeScript. You will also see how TypeScript's type system helps catch errors when working with these data structures. You will work with Enums, Tuples, and Interfaces to define complex data structures. You will also see how to make properties of objects optional.

## Topics Covered

- Array Types
- Object Types
- Enums
- Tuples
- Interfaces
- Optional Properties
- Type Safety with Arrays and Objects

## How to run the code

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the lesson03-Arrays_and_Objects directory.

```bash
cd lesson03-Arrays_and_Objects
```
3. Install TypeScript globally if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```
4. Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript using the Watch flag so you can see changes in real-time:

```bash
tsc -w
```
5. Open the `src/main.ts` file and make changes to see how TypeScript compiles it to JavaScript in the `build/js` directory.
6. Go to the build directory and open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the output.
7. Open the browser console to see the logged output from the TypeScript code. You can use the shortcut `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or `Cmd + Option + I` on Mac) to open the developer tools and navigate to the Console tab.
