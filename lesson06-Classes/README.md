# Lesson 06-Classes

This lesson covers the concepts of classes and their types in TypeScript.

## Topics Covered

- The `public`, `private`, `protected` and `static` type for class property initialization.
- Use of `readonly` property for class properties and methods.
- Literal types
- Revision of function types
- REST parameters
- The Never type
- Never type generated automatically by throwing errors
- Custom type guard
- Use of the never type

## How to run the code

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the lesson04-functions directory.

```bash
cd lesson04-functions
```
3. Install TypeScript globally if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```
4. Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript using the Watch flag so you can see changes in real-time:

```bash
tsc -w
```
5. Open the `src/main.ts` file and make changes to see how TypeScript compiles it to JavaScript in the `build/js` directory.
6. Go to the build directory and open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the output.
7. Open the browser console to see the logged output from the TypeScript code. You can use the shortcut `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or `Cmd + Option + I` on Mac) to open the developer tools and navigate to the Console tab.
