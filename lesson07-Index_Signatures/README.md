# Lesson 07-Index Signatures and Typeof Assertions

This lesson covers the concepts of Index Signatures for objects and using the typeof assertions to handle known keys in an Object.

## Topics Covered

- Index Signatures and where they are needed
- Using the `keyof` assertions
- Using the `keyof` assertions in combination with `typeof`

## How to run the code

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the lesson04-functions directory.

```bash
cd lesson07-Index_Signatures
```
3. Install TypeScript globally if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```
4. Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript using the Watch flag so you can see changes in real-time:

```bash
tsc -w
```
5. Open the `src/main.ts` file and make changes to see how TypeScript compiles it to JavaScript in the `build/js` directory.
6. Go to the build directory and open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the output.
7. Open the browser console to see the logged output from the TypeScript code. You can use the shortcut `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or `Cmd + Option + I` on Mac) to open the developer tools and navigate to the Console tab.
